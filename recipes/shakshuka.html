        <p>This is a slightly modified version of a popular Middle Eastern breakfast dish. It's easy, healthy, and satisfying! You can make it with fresh tomato and jalapeno as well.</p>
        <p>It only takes 10 minutes to prepare and 35 to cook, for a total of 45 mins. The tomato base can be prepared ahead of time, and will be even better the longer it sits. This recipe yields 4 servings.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, onion, and bell pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the canned tomatoes, paprika and jalapenos; stir, using the back of a spoon to break up the tomatoes. Simmer for about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Crack an egg into a small bowl, then gently slip the egg into the tomato sauce. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook the eggs until the whites are firm and the yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. If the tomato sauce gets dry, add a few tablespoons of water. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon, place onto a warm plate, and serve with the tomato sauce and pita bread.</li>
